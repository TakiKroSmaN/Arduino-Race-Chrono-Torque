# Arduino-Race-Chrono-Torque
Rece Chrono or Torque for cars without OBD II

This is my datalogger for car without OBD II in my case Honda Civic B16A2
You can connect with RaceChrono or Torque application using a buetooth HC-05 or HC-06.
I used Arduino Pro Micro.
In RaceChrono there is no, or I don't know how to create new sensor so I used water temp as gear pos and intake temp as VTEC indicator etc.
In Torque it's shows under correct names.
Base for Torque I have found here: https://torque-bhp.com/wiki/Arduino

there are some bugs for sure but in my car is working good enoght
